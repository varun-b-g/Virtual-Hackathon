# Virtual-Hackathon

The aim of this project is to analyse and predict COVID cases in the world.<br>
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>
The main goal of this project is to analyze the records, compare and identify the countries as HIGH RISK TRAVEL destination countries for Internship or Projectwork for next two years.<br>
An in depth analysis has been conducted on the number of COVID-19 cases reported against the age groups and the average death time and average recovery time of COVID-19 in various countries has been found out.<br>

Using python, this project analyzes the data of COVID-19 using suitable graphs and compares countries on various parameters on the growth of the virus.<br>

  The packages involves:<br>
* Sci-kit : Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines<br>
* pandas : Its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.<br>
* numpy : NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>
* plotly : Plotly Python library is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.<br>
